Dr. Brandt goes through material fast and doesn't seem to care if you memorize, as long as you can analyze. It would have been nice to have bio first, but it was not too hard to keep up when I was reading the textbook before class. Exams were take home and can be with a group, but the questions are tough and very long.","quality":"4.0","difficulty":"4.0","grade":"A-","tag":"TOUGH GRADER\nGET READY TO READ\nGROUP PROJECTS","likes":"0","dislikes":"0","dates":"2022-11-28","course":"CHEM330","profFirstName":"Mark","profLastName":"Brandt "},{"comment":"For Credit: Yes\nAttendance: Mandatory\nWould Take Again: Yes\nGrade: \nTextbook: No\nEngaging lectures and always ready to explain side topics that may interest you. Honestly the best professor I have had at Rose. Less focus on memorization and more of a focus on understanding global concepts. All exams are group and take home.
