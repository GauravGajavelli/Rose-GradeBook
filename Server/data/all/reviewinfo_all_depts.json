We had a flipped classroom, where you'd watch (a ton of) lecture videos before class. The thing is he also lectured during class, essentially repeating the knowledge I'd already gained from the videos. This inefficiency made the class more work than all my others combined.

Tests can be hard since you actually have to understand what you're doing instead of just plugging in numbers but when the final comes you'll be super prepared compared to other students.
