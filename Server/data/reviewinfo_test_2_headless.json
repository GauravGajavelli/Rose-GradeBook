Gardner was incredibly invested in the subject which made the class pretty interesting, and while he wasn't the best lecturer the class was pretty easy.

There are little assignments/readings to do daily (not hard at all). Tests were simple; they resemble activities in the book. He learned in Spain (talks with a ceceo / uses vosotros). I liked it but some may be confused. Most of us tested into the class and were at different levels; he handled it well.","quality":"5.0","difficulty":"3.0","grade":"A","tag":"PARTICIPATION MATTERS\nCLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","likes":"0","dislikes":"0","dates":"2023-03-01","course":"SPANL212","profFirstName":"John","profLastName":"Gardner "},{"comment":"For Credit: Yes\nAttendance: Mandatory\nWould Take Again: Yes\nGrade: \nTextbook: Yes\nSuper kind person. Assigns quite a few textbook activities for HW which you go over in class. Do the HW since the exams are basically textbook exercises. Creates an environment where people can practice speaking & make mistakes. All main assessments are written. Usually speaks in Spanish but talks slowly & uses cognates to ensure you understand.","quality":"5.0","difficulty":"2.0","grade":"A+","tag":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK\nGRADED BY FEW THINGS\nCARING","likes":"0","dislikes":"0","dates":"2022-02-19","course":"SPANL212","profFirstName":"John","profLastName":"Gardner "},{"comment":"For Credit: Yes\nAttendance: Mandatory\nWould Take Again: Yes\nGrade: \nTextbook: Yes\nDr. Gardner is a great professor.

Assigns homework for the next day that is basically a clear preview for what will be discussed and done in class.

He tends to dumb concepts down to make sure people understand him which is good. Tests are a BIT challenging, and its pretty hard to get an A on a composition, but the trick is participation.
