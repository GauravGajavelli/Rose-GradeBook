She clearly had control of the classroom and felt really prepared every day. 100% would enjoy a class with her again.","quality":"5.0","difficulty":"2.0","grade":"A","tag":"GROUP PROJECTS\nLECTURE HEAVY\nACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","likes":"0","dislikes":"0","dates":"2024-02-25","course":"CSSE333","profFirstName":"Amanda","profLastName":"Stouder "},{"comment":"For Credit: Yes\nAttendance: Mandatory\nWould Take Again: Yes\nGrade: \nTextbook: Yes\nContrary to what the majority of these reviews say, I think Stouder has really grown as a professor and truly cares about her students.
